# Diagnostics

Status: Current infrastructure and conventions.

`include/gti/diagnostic.h` defines the structured diagnostic contract shared by
source loading, lexing, parsing, semantics, the driver, the backend, CLI, and
LSP.

## Data Model

`Diagnostic` contains:

- a stable code;
- owning phase and severity;
- one primary `SourceSpan`;
- a user-facing message;
- optional related spans, fix-its, and hints.

`SourceSpan` is a source identity plus half-open UTF-8 byte offsets and a
one-based line hint. `SourceManager` owns exact source text and computes display
locations. LSP UTF-16 conversion occurs at the protocol boundary; compiler
diagnostics do not store LSP positions.

Current phase prefixes are `GTI-L` (lexing), `GTI-I` (source/include loading),
`GTI-P` (parsing), `GTI-S` (semantics), and `GTI-B` (driver/backend families).
Use the existing local family and number rather than inventing a parallel code
scheme.

## Production Rules

- Diagnose invalid GTI in the earliest authoritative frontend phase. A native
  C++ diagnostic is not a substitute for a language diagnostic.
- Point the primary span at the token/range the user can act on. Use related
  diagnostics for conflicting declarations, includes, or instantiation sites.
- Give a concrete rule and correction; do not expose backend helper names.
- Add a fix-it only when the edit is mechanically correct for every program
  that produces the diagnostic. Include a concise action message.
- Preserve parser recovery and avoid cascades. A diagnostic change must not
  silently discard later valid declarations.
- Reserve `GTI-B0001` for internal MIR/backend integrity failure, not ordinary
  invalid source.

The LSP publishes diagnostics from the same versioned `FrontendResult` used by
semantic queries. It always preserves the stable code, severity, source, and
plain-text message. Related information and structured diagnostic data are
included only when the client advertises support; structured data carries the
compiler phase, hints, and fix-its while hints also remain in the plain-text
message for clients without data support.

Quick-fix code actions are generated only from current compiler-owned `FixIt`
records. The request range must intersect the diagnostic, the client-provided
diagnostic must exactly match the current publication, and every edit target
must still have the analyzed source. Literal code actions and `isPreferred` are
returned only when the client advertises the corresponding capabilities.

## Tests

Add the smallest focused assertion for code, message fragment, primary span,
related information, hints, and fix-it as applicable. Negative tests should
also assert that code generation is disabled and that recovered neighboring
syntax remains available when relevant. Run the owning CTest target plus LSP
protocol tests when publication or edits change.

Use the repository [`add-diagnostic`](../../.codex/skills/add-diagnostic/SKILL.md)
skill for the repeatable workflow.
